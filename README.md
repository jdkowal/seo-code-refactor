refactoring html and css

In order to make the application work click on the link 
[seo code refactor](https://jdkowal.github.io/seo-code-refactor/)

The goal of this exercise was to refactor the html and css in a more logical and efficient way by making things more semantic and optimizing seo. Some of the goals outlined in the project were as read: 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In web application I removed most id tags and replaced them with semantic elements which then helped reduce redundant css code. I provided more user accessability by including alt tags to img files. I made sure the css flowed in a logical order. I made sure that after my edits my links functioned properly.

The goal was to maintain the way that the application looked which was

I believe that that goal was achieved.
